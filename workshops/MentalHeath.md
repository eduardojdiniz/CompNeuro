Ribeiro (Special Programs Coordinator at the Office of Intramural Training & Education, NIH), Timothy Verstynen (Associate Professor of Psychology at CMU).
* What are strategies that you have found effective at maintaing mental health and wellness?

- You do have agency!
- To do well, you need to be well.
- Prioritize mental health.
- Mentoring young generation.
- Mental health as a top priority.

## Stressor
- Competition and not collaboration.
- Isolation in the work environment.
- Mismatch between the external and internal expectations.
- High achieving culture mentality.
- Impostor fear.
- Resilience / critical thinking.
- Everyone has specific stressor.
- Mentors need to be able to recognize mental health challenges of their trainees.

- There are the worried-well and the worried-sick.
- Uncertainty about the future
- Work-life balance issue: time(visa)/money(grant) limit.
- Realistic expectations from mentors, yourself, and peers.
- Communication with mentor/peers.
- Create a support group.
- Building and maintaing relationship.
- Seeking support is not weakness.
- A wellness center is not enough, we need a community.
- Conflict between science being perceived as a communial environment and the internal reality of a highly competitive environment.
- We are always moving (disentanglement from our support group).
- Just open the door so that you make clear you are listening and they have a space to talk.
- Take care of your mental heath so you are sensitive to other people struggles.
- Culture of superhuman: I overlooked sleep my entire academic life. Prioritizing sleep is making a huge difference in my mood and wellbeing. I wish I learned early the importance of proper scheduling my school/research work to promote a healthy sleeping habits. Enforcing a schedule at the work environment helps a lot.
- You are not taking anything from anyone else if you provide support. You are only helping.

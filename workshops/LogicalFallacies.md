Contextual modulations of self-reports can reflect very real contextual modulations of experience. Just because experience/belief differs from objective behavior or brain activity doesn't mean it's meaningless... if I say "hey your amygdala isn't active" but you still report feeling fear, shouldn't I believe you?

@Megan, "hey your amygdala isn't active but you still report"...made me think of the patients in vegetative state from early in the talk. How can you self-report using brain activation when if there are circumstance that there are a mismatch between the two?

@Eduardo it's about the meaning of the 'answers' you're getting, I think. We (scientists) believe that amygdala activity level predicts fear level based on animal research etc. We think that the amygdala "does" fear. But "playing tennis" doesn't "do" "yes my father's name is Alexander". So the arbitrary association might be a key element in differentiating these two

When does the association start have meaning?

## Computational Programs @ NIMH

- Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Program
This program supports empirical and theoretical studies of self-organizing behavior in neuronal systems, mathematical approaches to modeling non-stationary neuronal processes, functional imaging of dynamical systems, and the modeling of all levels of neuronal processing, from single cell activity to complex behaviors. Projects typically combine mathematical and computational tools with neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, or neurochemical techniques in order to decipher the mechanisms underlying specific neuronal and behavioral systems.

- Computational Psychiatry Program
This program fosters biologically-based computational frameworks to identify  and validate biomarkers and novel treatment targets to the prevention, treatment, and recovery of psychiatric disorders. The program supports translational research using analytical approaches for the prediction of risk and treatmenbt response and the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying mental disorders.

- Integrative Computational Neuroscience and Brain Reward Systems Program
This program supports basic experimental and theoretical research focusing on biophysically based, multi-scale computational modeling of celluar and molecular pathways in brain circuits, including those that link cellular and sub-cellular activity to neural systems that underlie complex mental health relevant behavior. We encourage data-driven studies that provide model of

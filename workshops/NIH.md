# Understanding and Modifying Temporal Dynamics of Coordinated Neural Activity (RO1 or R21 Clinical Trial Optional)
- Mauricio Rangel-Gomez, Ph.D., NIMH Program DIrector: Learning and Memory Program, mauricio.range-Gomez@nih.gov

These FOAs are based on the idea that cognition emerge at the level of populations of neurons:
* Information represented and organized as action potentials and network events.
* Temporally coordinated.

Current basic and translational findings should be expanded to better understand the brain algorithms that implement learning, memory consolidation, attention, reasoning, affect regulation, and **social interactions**.

Applications must address at least one of the following topic areas:
* Temporal dynamics of neural patterns that impact cognition, affect, or social behavior: projects should manipulate specific aspects of the electrophysiological patterns that can potentially alter these domains.
* Understanding how molecular aberrations lead to systems-level discoordination: changes to the coordination of electrophysiological patterns of brain activity, resulting from changes at the celluar or molecular levels.
* Animal-to-human translation: changes in neural coordination patterns that alter cognition in animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive changes in healthy humans and/or clinical populations.
* **Computational modelling: biologically realistic computational models of the algorithms and mechanisms by which neural coordination patterns across brain areas affect cognitive, affective, and social processing.**
* Example of a funded project: [Wallis and Knudsen (2020), Closed-Loop Theta Stimulation in the Orbitofrontal Cortex Prevents Reward-Based Learning.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320301021?via%3Dihub) Study coordinate temporal dynamics of two different regions within a cognitive process.
* Lonliness and isolation in older adults, e.g., resting state (+questionnare), look for individual differences that correspond to vulnerability and resilience. Maybe high-temporal resolution 7T -> there is evidence of oscillatory activity in the brain of older adults plays a big role in sleep-wake, lymphatic. Relate fastEPI with fMRI. See slow changes due to oxygenation with the immediate changes due to the motion; vascular vs. neural components. Preliminary data: at high-temporal resolution (particular to this site).

# Research on Biopsychosocial Factors of Social Connectedness and Isolation on Health, Wellbeing, Illness, and Recovery (PAR-21-145)
- Andrew Breeden, Ph.D., NIMH Program DIrector: SOcial and Affective Neuroscience Program, andrew.breeden@nih.gov

Social ties influence:
* General wellbeing
* Recovery from acute ilness
* Management of chronic conditions

Need a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, processes, and trajectories in social connectedness and isolation.

This FOA solicits research to better model the basic individual, social, and biobehavioral processes by which social connectedness and isolation have positive and negative impacts across the lifespan.

* Neurobiological mechanisms associated with disruption of social connectedness, isolation, or perceived loneliness.
* Effects of social connection and/or isolation on affective, social, and cognitive outcomes across levels of analysis.
* Biophychosocial mechanisms which increase social connectedness.
* **Computational neuroscience approaches to characterize social group dynamics and/or individual experience of social interactions and their impacts on emotional or cognitive systems and abilities**.
* Mechanisms through which social isolation impacts mental health treatment engagement, adherence, and/or continuation.
* Mechanism-based research to identify potential intervention targets for modifying social connectedness.

# Computationaly-defined Behaviors in Psychiatry (RFA-MH-19-240)
- Sia Vaziri, Ph.D., Director, Integrative Computational Neuroscience and Brain Reward System Program, siavash.vaziri@nih.gov
- (presented) Michele Ferrante, Ph.D., NIMH Program Director: Computational Neuroscience/Computational Psychiatry, ferrantem@nih.gov
- R21

## Computationally informed behavioral assay development
- Theory-driven, e.g., reinforcement learning, diffuse-drift models.

Longer Term Goals

This is for humans, but these models need to be back-translatable to rodents. Reason: behavioral tasks given to rodents are not representative of mental health.

* **Back-Translation:**
    * Testing and validation in animals.
    * Integration with causal neurobiological experimental designs to expand mechanistic understanding.
    * Integration into pre-clinical study design for more predictive, translatable therapeutic discovery in animals.

* **Clinical Applications:**
    * Classification and quantification of behavioral heterogeneity in humans.
    * Integration with neurobiological measures to expand understanding underlying pathophysiology.
    * Determination of therapeutic strategies and stratification of patients for treatment decisions.

# Computational Approaches for Validating Dimensional Constructs of Relevance to Psychopathology
- Michele Ferrante, Ph.D., NIMH Program Director: Computational Neuroscience/Computational Psychiatry, ferrantem@nih.gov

## RDoC Validations
- 1/3 of the funded translational research are RDoC based.
- **Deconstructed, parsed, and diagnosed.** A hypothetical example illustrates how precision medicine might deconstruct traditional symptom-based categories. Patients with a range of mood disorders are studied across several analytical platforms to parse current heterogeneous syndromes into homogeneous clusters.
- Take symptom-based categorized subjects (e.g., major depressive disorder, mild depression i.e. cysthymia, bipolar depression), pool them together and collect integrated data (e.g., genetic risk via polygenic risk score, brain activity via insula cortex, physiology via inflammatory markers, behavioral process via affecitve bias, life experience via social, cutural, and environmental factors) for unsupervised data-driven clustering in order to find shared biological mechanism via prospective replication and stratified clinical trials.

1. Fostering **collaborations between clincal researchers & computational neuroscientists** using theory- and or data-driven models. Must include:
* **Two RDoC-like constructs**
    * <details>
         <summary>Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)</summary>

         [RDoC](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc) is a research framework for investigating mental disorders. It integrates many levels of information (from genomics and circuits to behavior and self-report) to explore basic dimensions of functioning that span the full range of human behavior from normal to abnormal.
     </details>

* **Two levels of analysis** (brain-based measure & behavior)
* **Multiple behavioral tasks per construct**, for convergent validity, i.e., more changes to recruit the circuits involved in the studied construct.
2. Utilizing **accelerated longitudinal studies** (focusing on childhood and adolescence) to predict optimal neurodevelopmental stage for interventions.
3. Explicating the dimensions and constructs of interest through the inclusion of **healthy subjects and patients from multiple diagnostic groups**.

**Goal** Perform a computational validation of existing construct that may involve <span style="color:red"> finding continua, merging, subdividing, </span> or <span style="color:red"> hierarchically organizing </span> between and within constructs in the [RDoC matrix](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/constructs/rdoc-matrix).

# Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Decoding and Modulating Behaviorally-Activated Brain Circuits ([PAR-19-344](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-19-344.html))
- Michele Ferrante, Ph.D., NIMH Program Director: Computational Neuroscience/Computational Psychiatry, ferrantem@nih.gov

**Goal:** To develop eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) solutions for behavioral neuromodulation.

XAI approaches combine machine learning with effective explanatory methods to enable a mechanistic understanding of the solutions provided by the computational model.

**Approach:** XAI would integrate theory- and data-driven models for precise solutions and causal explanations of closed-loop neuromodulation of brain and behavioral signals (multimodal datasets).


Explainability (notational): plot prediction accuracy vs. Explainability, e.g., DL has high accuracy and low explainability while Decision trees are high explainability, but low accuracy.

New Approach: Create machine learning techniques that produce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance.

Deep Explanation: Modified deep-learning techniques to learn explainable features from the signals across the nodes of the network:
* Hierarchy of physiology: EPSCs &rarr; Cell firing &rarr; Oscillations &rarr; Synchrony between regions. Temporal structure in behavior to identify "atomic" components.

Today:
* Training Data &rarr; Machine Learning Process &rarr; Learned Function &rarr; Decision or Recommendation &rarr; User &larr; Task
* Task &rarr; Learned Function
* User about Model
    * Why did you do that?
    * Why not something else?
    * When do you succeed?
    * When do you fail?
    * When can I trust you?
    * How do I correct an error?

Deep learning is great at classifying and predicting but terrible at explaining.

XAI:
* Training Data &rarr; New Machine Learning Process &rarr; Explainable Model/Explanation Interface &lrarr; User &larr; Task
* Task &rarr; Explainable Model
* User about Model
    * I understand why
    * I understand why not
    * I know when you succeed
    * I know when you fail
    * I know when to trust you
    * I know when you erred

### Marr's Tri-level anaysis
* Computational: problem to be solved
* Algorithmic: how?
* Implementational: physical system. Note that this does not only refers to biology but it could include mode macro-systems such as laws, architecture, etc.

* Example: Reinforcement Learning
    * Computational: Optimising and adapting individual's choices in uncertain environments.
    * Algorithmc: AI inspired learning via prediction erros (Temporal Difference Models)
    * Implementational: Dopamine responses mirroring prediction errors.

- Assay Development is a procedure in molecular biology for testing or measuring the activity of a drug or biochemical in an organism or organic sample. A quantitative assay may also measure the amount of a substance in a sample.

A theoretical model of a behavior phenotype can be achieved by:
    - **Breaking down the behavior into fine-grained parameters** that can be mathematically described.
    - **Integrating the behavior parameters in an experimentally-grounded mathematical formalism (i.e., a new behavioral theory).** The model should integrate prior experimental findings, allow the tracking of all parameters and predict behavioral outcomes.
    - **Experimentally validating and optimizing these theory-driven models.** Rigorous determination of the relationship between all the behavioral parameters and the behavioral outcomes. Demostration that the model can make behaviorally accurate predictions for a new experiment or dataset.
## Example: A computational model of social interactions

The probability to engage in a given social interaction (this is the complex behavior) depends upon a set of parameters:
* Individual social traits at baseline ($w_0$)
* Value of social reward (SR), e.g., interaction with a male or female, how long since last interaction.
* Value of non-social rewards (NSR), e.g., spinning a wheel.
* Social Prediction Error (SPE).
* SR received by you ($U_j$) exceeds the SR received by others ($O_j$).
* SR received by $O_j$ exceeds $U_j$.
* Forgetting factor ($\gamma$).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textrm{SI}_{(t)} &= w_0 \\
                  &+ w_1\sum_{j=1}^t \gamma^{t-j}\textrm{SR}_j \\
                  &- w_2\sum_{j=1}^t \gamma^{-j}\textrm{NSR}_j \\
                  &+ w_3\sum_{j=1}^t \gamma^{t-j}\textrm{SPE}_j \\
                  &- w_4\sum_{j=1}^t \gamma^{-j}\max(O_j-U_j,0) \\
                  &+ w_5\sum_{j=1}^t \gamma^{t-j}\max(U_j-O_j,0)

## NOT-OD-21-094: Improve AI/ML-Readiness of NIH-Supported Data

This initiative is aligned with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, which describes actions aimed at modernizing the biomedical research data ecosystem and making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) with high impact for open science.

The same software used by NASA scientists to determine the depths of lakes from space ([Hierarchical Image Segmentation i.e. HSEG](https://ntts-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/t2p/prod/t2media/tops/pdf/GSC-TOPS-14.pdf)) is being tested for use in medical-image analysis for mammography, X Rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, as well as for ultrasound measurements.

AI/ML tools, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, which are used to build and deploy AI/ML applications, both require specific data formats. Important biomedical AI/ML applications often require data from different sources to be combined, so making the data FAIR through the use of data and metadata standards (ontologies, taxonomies, terminologies) is a foundational component of AI/ML-readiness.

In addition to AI/ML-readiness of the data and metadata themselves, there are increasing expectations around data documentation to include information about data provenance, motivation, compositon, collection process, recomended uses, bias that would help researchers make more informed and ethical decisions from the data. For example, imbalanced datasets can result in AI/ML algorithms that lead to biased clinical decisions and, potentially, a misalignment with NIH goals to improve minority health and reduce health disparities for marginalized populations. AI/ML-readiness should be guided by a concern for human and clinical impact and therefore requires attention to ethical, legal, and social implications of AI/ML including but not limited to: (1) biases in datasets, algorithms, and applications; (2) concerns related to privacy and confidentiality; (3) impacts on disadvantaged or marginalized groups and health disparities; and (4) unintended, adverse social consequences of research and development.

## Tutorial 1

- Richard Naud

How are action potentials generated given current flowing into cell body from dendrites and synapses?

'Leak' -> model current leaking through the membrane not through the ions channels

Replace I_Na and I_K by a threshold for spike emission followed by a reset to a fixed potential.

Siegert Equation

Fluctuation-driven regime: firing mainly driven by variance (high CV)

Mean-driven regime: mainly driven by mean (low CV)

The variability of the responses depends on both the mean and variance of the input, not only on the variance.

Rheobase current

F-I curve: input-output transfer function.

For a Poisson process there is no relationship between spike rate and spike irregularity.

## Tutorial 2

Campbell's theorem

Perstimulus time histogram

# Tutorial 3

What statistical property of the pre-synaptic ensemble is transmitted to the post-synaptic neuron?

Tsodyks Markram Model

Free Membrane Potential (FMP)

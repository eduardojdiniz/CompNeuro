What? = Descriptive: Compact summary of large amounts of data. Is a picture a "what" model?
How? = Mechanistic: How a system produces (complex) data. Is a camera a "how" model?
Why? = interpretive: Why a system has a particular cost function. Is "to post on social media" a "why" model?

why(how(what))

Normative models: optimal solution to real world problems.

Marr's 3 levels of analysis
    1 - Computational level: What is the cost function of the system? How close it is to optimal?
    2 - Algorithmic level: What are the data structures, approximations, runtime?
    3 - Implementation level: What is the hardware (e.g., neurons, synapses, molecules)?

Model ingredients: goals, evaluation framework (who are the peers), capabilities, expectations, and limitations.

# Dynamical Systems

## Intro

## Tutorial 1

- Bing Wen Brunton

"Linear systems are all alike; every nonlinear system is nonlinear in its own way"

Linear Dynamical Systems = calculus + linear algebra

Stream plot

Phase portrait

## Tutorial 2

Probabilistic/Stochastic dynamical systems.

A system is Markovian if the present state determines the probability of transitions to the next state.

A telegraph process

if Closed:
    Transition to open P(o2c)

else:

Transition to closed P(c2o)

Poisson process models discrete events where the average time between event occurrences is known but the exact timing is not known.

Propagation of probabilities in time

## Tutorial 3

Random Walks in Biology, Berg

Diffusive process: the mean of the distribution is independent of time, but the variance and standard deviation of the distribution scale with time.

## Tutorial 4

Autoregressive model: Regression of the data onto itself.

First-order autoregressive: the time series is a function of itself one step in the past.

Higher order autoregression models -> multiple regression (incorporate time-history dependence)

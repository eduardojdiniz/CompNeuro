- The mind is capable of identify invariances and regularities.

- The brain weights ~1.5 Kg, occupies 1260 cm^3, covers 2500 cm^2, consumes 25 Watts (20% of body $O_2$), and routes 400 miles of capillaries.


- A neuron can be classified primarly according to Dale's Dogma: in general, a neuron either makes excitatory or inhibitory synapses.

- 1 minicolumn has 100 neurons; 1 macrocolumn has 100 minicolumns; 1 cortical sheet has 2 million macrocolumns. Hence, 1 cortical sheet, 2 million macrocolumns, 200 million minicolumns, 20 billion neurons.

-  A minicolumn is usually organized in a motif of 6 layers: input information arrives at layer 4, which forwards it upwards to layers 2/3, which fowards downward to layers 5/6 or to higher cortical regions.

- Neocortex's local connectivity (within a cortical layer; horizontal): short-range connections are distance dependent and in long-range neurons make patchy connections.

- Neocortex's large-scale connectivity: Highly non-random and hierarchical connectivity across cortical regions. The pattern of connectivity is largely determined by genetics: it is species- or perhaps indiviual-specificy.

- Neither the number of neurons (e.g., ~86 Billion neurons in the average Human brain vs. ~257 Billion neurons in the average Elephant), nor the diversity of neurons types are sufficient to account for the complexity of the Human brain function. It is more problable to be the number of connections: ~10,000 synapses per neuron (sends and receives ~10,000 synapses), ~10 Trillion synapses. The connection speed is decent (i.e., delay between distant regions): axon conduction speed ~220 Miles/hour, axon length ~100,000 Miles. The connectivity is dense in the scale of a neuron, but sparse in the scale of the neocortex, due to distance/speed of connections and dynamic connection strength due to development/learning.

- The brain can be approximate as a network of networks: local connectivity with it's own rules of connection and organization and long range input from other regions and external stimulation.

- To study brain funcion (i.e., neural correlates of behavior) we relate the behavior to brain activity. To find causal links we need to record brain activity in normal and pertubed (e.g., lesions or brain diseases) conditions.

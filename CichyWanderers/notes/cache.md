In the beginning of the trial there will be an above chance correlation with faces due to prior, and as evidence come in.

Higher variance for inanimate objects than faces.

In the decoding time RDM we noticed that for faces, the average delay for maximum discrimination with respect to all other objects is the same; 220 ms.

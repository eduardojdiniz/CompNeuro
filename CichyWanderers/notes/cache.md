Skip connections (residual connections) are a way to implement feedback in Deep nets

Liquid State Machines = spiking reservour 

Feedback connections to combine information from early layers + posterior layers.

Split MEG into categories and see if there is significant difference in timings.

mean correlation 

RNNs potentially

Images that are not easily discriminative


track individual cells in the RDM instead of the overall correlation between two matrices.

argmax(RDM(t))
In the beginning of the trial there will be an above chance correlation with faces due to prior, and as evidence come in.

Higher variance for inanimate objects than faces.

In the decoding time RDM we noticed that for faces, the average delay for maximum discrimination with respect to all other objects is the same; 220 ms.

RDM Regression (partial correlation): Regress out RDM from Layer 1 (confound low level image stats)
